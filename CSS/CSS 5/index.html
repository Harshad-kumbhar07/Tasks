   <div class="box box0"><h1 >Jason Roy dropped from England’s T20 World Cup squad</h1>
    <P>Following a poor run of form with the bat, opener Jason Roy has been left out of England’s squad for the T20 World Cup in October and for their T20 tour of Pakistan later this month.
 
     The 32-year-old opener has scored just 78 runs in six T20Is. He also began his Hundred campaign 
     for the Oval Invincible with three ducks in four innings. He missed the Invincibles’
      final two games of the season due to lower back stiffness, 
     including Wednesday night’s crucial defeat to Originals at Old Trafford

        <P>Pakistan vs Hong Kong (PAK vs HKG), Asia Cup 2022 Live Streaming: Babar Azam will lead Pakistan against Nizakath
             Khan-led Hong Kong in the last group match of Asia Cup 2022 on Friday in Sharjah.
              This will be the first match between the two teams in the shortest format.

            Pakistan are tipped to be the favourite to clinch a place in the Super 4. 
            Hong Kong was beaten by table-toppers India on Wednesday in Dubai.
             Pakistan had lost a nail-biter against India on Sunday as well.

    <p>The end was anticlimactic for a wildly emotional match. Ashita Fernando and Maheesh
         Theekshana scampered for a two that brought Sri Lanka within a run of beating Bangladesh
          and sealing a Super Fours spot. That’s when the umpire signalled a no-ball, robbing an 
          occasion for spontaneous celebration. The moment they realised they had won, Fernando 
          and Maheesh hugged each other and waved frenziedly at the dressing room. The teammates came rushing,
        leaping and punching the air, gesturing to the Sri Lanka supporters to raise the volume level.</p>

     <p>The long minutes beside the fully-occupied nets waiting for his turn to bowl feels like 
        hours for Shahnawaz Dahani. Wearing a warm smile, he measures and remeasures his run-up
        , strokes his stubbled face, brushes the grass of his studs, rehearses his action repeatedly, 
        prances around restlessly here and there,
         whispers something to a support staff that has him in splits. And then he hears the
