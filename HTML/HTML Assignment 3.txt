        <p><h3> Another exhilarating Test match</h3></p>
            in this seriesthe ebbs and flows aplenty, from the opening spell from Bumrah 
            on the first morning to Sam Curran's gutsy half-ton in the first innings. Cheteshwar Pujara's meticulous ton 
            evened out the match after both sides had batted as Moeen Ali scalped five wickets.</p>
           <p>&emsp;  &emsp;  &emsp; Jos Buttler's half-century in the second innings complimented by Sam Curran's contribution setup an interesting 245-run 
            target for India to chase down. When Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane put one hundred runs together for India, they were
         beautifully poised to chase the runs down and level the series. Moeen Ali and Ben Stokes then bowled purposely 
         and provided the last swing in the match, in England's favor, to secure the series.</p>

         <p>&emsp;  &emsp;  &emsp; England have taken an unassailable 3-1 lead in the series. Going to the Oval, India will be keen to salvage some pride
          and finish with a win. Virat Kohli has already indicated that his team will approach the fixture with all the seriousness
         it deserves albeit having lost the series at this point.</p>
